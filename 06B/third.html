                <h2>Here are some interesting facts about cats!</h2>
                <ul class = "ulmargin">
                    <li>A house cat’s genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle ancestors, says Layla Morgan Wilde, a cat behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101. These behaviors include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing, chinning, and urine marking.</li>
                    <li>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.</li>
                    <li>Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans.</li>
                    <li>Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).</li>
                    <li>Cats can jump up to six times their length.</li>
                    <li>Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.</li>
                    <li>Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these bones are buried in their shoulder muscles.</li>
                    <li>Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.</li>
                    <li>Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at you with her mouth open from time to time.</li>
                    <li>Cats have whiskers on the backs of their front legs, as well.</li>
                    <li>Cats have nearly twice the amount of neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs.</li>
                    <li>Cats have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any mammal.</li>
                    <li>Cats make very little noise when they walk around. The thick, soft pads on their paws allow them to sneak up on their prey — or you!</li>
                    <li>Cats’ rough tongues can lick a bone clean of any shred of meat.</li>
                    <li>Cats use their long tails to balance themselves when they’re jumping or walking along narrow ledges.</li>
